                    <p>
                        Welcome to the new Official Rumble Website. This specific url will be used to dump info on internal updates for us weekly players (if you are not a weekly player this will be boring)
                        As you can see theres a good amount of changes just from the visual end but a few more to note on the user side.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Support For NON-Weekly events</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is something I hope will encourage some games and data outside of Wednesdays. When creating a new event on the events page there will no be a modal popup with settings to fill.
                        There you can toggle Weekly off. Essentially that just means the matches are played not on our normal wednesday night magic. This will allow people to make events and play some pickup rumble whenever they want.
                    </p>
